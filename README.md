## OSemBOT: Natural Language Command Line Interface Bot
OSemBOT is a project that allows users to interact with their computer's command line interface using natural language input. The bot is built using a combination of the OpenAI API, Python, UiPath, and VB.net.

## How it works
OSemBOT is designed to interpret natural language commands entered by the user and execute corresponding OS commands in the command line interface. The bot consists of two main components:

The front-end, which is responsible for receiving user input and passing it to the OpenAI API for interpretation
The back-end, which receives the interpreted command from the OpenAI API and executes the corresponding OS command using UiPath and VB.net scripts.
## Features
Natural language input: Users can enter commands in English, making it easier to interact with the command line interface for those who are not familiar with traditional command line syntax.

Automation: The bot can automate common tasks, reducing the need for manual input and improving productivity.

Accessibility: The bot's natural language interface can make the command line interface more accessible to a wider range of users.
## Getting started
To use OSemBOT, you will need to have Python, UiPath, and VB.net installed on your computer. You will also need to obtain an API key from OpenAI to access their natural language processing API.

Clone the OSemBOT repository to your local machine.
Install the necessary Python packages by running pip install -r requirements.txt in the project directory.
Obtain an API key from OpenAI and replace the placeholder API key in os_bot.py with your own key.
Run os_bot.py to start the bot.
Enter natural language commands and watch as OSemBOT executes corresponding OS commands in the command line interface.
